‚óè	Engineered a temperature-controlled oven/cooler using a thermo-electric cooler (TEC) and a thermistor temperature sensor; debugged performance bottlenecks and issues 

o	Interfaced TEC and thermistor to a MSP430 microcontroller; wrote embedded C code

o	Implemented PID control; control and temperature information were relayed between the microcontroller and PC via a USB-to-UART serial bridge 

o	A GUI was implemented in MATLAB which allowed user to set and monitor temperature
